    "content": "Torako Koshi is the epitome of perfection. With her peerless beauty, top-notch grades, and position as student council president, her popularity in school is unrivaled. However, she harbors a dark secret—she was a delinquent back in middle school—and this is something she conceals to the best of her abilities. \n Unfortunately, when she meets the mysterious deer girl Noko Shikanoko, Torako's hidden shame is constantly on the precipice of being exposed due to Shikanoko's rather weird antics. To maintain the reputation she worked so hard for, Torako must go along with Shikanoko's whims, even going so far as to become president of the newly established Deer Club. All her efforts will be rewarded if she can prevent the menacing doe from accidentally blurting out damaging details about her personal history that will undoubtedly unleash Torako's greatest nightmare.",

Yuuki Kagurazaka and Kazalim are conspiring with the Harlequin Alliance to bring about Rimuru's downfall. Furthermore, the Western Holy Church continues its intolerant crusade against Rimuru and his non-human subordinates.

But once the first domino inevitably falls, the race to supremacy begins.",

As they revisit the memories of their young love, the romance between them is rekindled, inspiring similar feelings in the younger members of their family.",

    "content": "Seirei Academy is a prestigious school attended by the very best students in Japan. Alisa Mikhailovna \"Alya\" Kujou, the half-Russian and half-Japanese treasurer of the school's student council, is known for her intelligence, stunning looks, and rigid personality. Contrasting her near-flawless persona, Alya's unmotivated classmate Masachika Kuze slacks off during lessons and seems to show no interest in her.\n Initially irritated, Alya gradually becomes more intrigued by Masachika and starts expressing her affection for him in Russian. However, she is oblivious to his secret—he understands the language fluently! Due to a childhood friend who was temporarily staying in Japan, Masachika has been studying Russian in hopes of reuniting with her. \n As the two spend more time together, the playful and eccentric relationship between them quickly deepens. In the meantime, both must learn to navigate their new growing feelings for one another",
